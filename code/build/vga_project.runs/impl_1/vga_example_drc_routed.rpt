2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3 output my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__0 output my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__1 output my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#4 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__2 output my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3 multiplier stage my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__0 multiplier stage my_draw_rect_ctl/ypos_tmp_nxt3__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0).

If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

DPOP-2#3 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_draw_rect_ctl/refresh_counter_nxt_reg[20]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_draw_rect_ctl/refresh_counter_nxt_reg[20]_i_2/O, cell my_draw_rect_ctl/refresh_counter_nxt_reg[20]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
